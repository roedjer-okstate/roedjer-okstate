Hello, I'm Roe Djer Tan! üëã
===========================

I'm currently a Master's student in Business Analytics and Data Science at Oklahoma State University, with a background in Mechanical Engineering. With a passion for Machine Learning and AI, I've amassed 2 years of experience in Data Science as of 2024. I'm on a journey to explore the vast potential of analytics and predictive modeling in solving real-world problems.

Technologies & Tools üîß
-----------------------

*   **Programming Languages & Libraries**: Python, R, SQL, Tensorflow, OpenAI, Torch
*   **Data Visualization & Analysis**: Tableau (Certified TDS), PowerBI, JMP Pro
*   **Big Data & Cloud**: Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Databricks
*   **Specializations**: Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Projects üìä
-----------

*   **Optimizing Spatial Sensing Performance with Kriging and SRGAN**: Utilized Kriging and Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network to enhance sensor data accuracy. [IEEE Publication](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10325319) - Demonstration of deep learning using `Torch`
*   **Large Language Model Group Exercise**: Applied LangChain to demonstrate implementation of chatbot with `Retrieval Augmented Generation` (Since the same concepts are done in my previous company with NDA, this is just a demonstration with non-sensitive data).
*   **Wharton People Analytics Case Competition**: Showcased 2nd runner-up in an international case competition incorporating factor analysis, segmentation, and Generative AI to tackle intricate real-world workplace problems.
*   **Bank Term Deposit Subscription**: Demonstration of the use of `PySpark` to solve business problem.
*   **Optimal Discount Strategy Model for Subsription Based Model**: Optimization modeling example.
*   **Customer Lifetime Value Analysis**: Showed understanding on churn and margin modeling as well as estimating customer lifetime value. Then, customer segmentation is done to provide targeted strategies.
*   **Sarcasm Detection in Social Media**: Implemented NLP techniques to detect sarcasm in social media comments, enhancing content understanding.
*   **DataLemur SQL**: Showcased SQL abilities.
*   **Rent Prices Trend Analysis in Stillwater**: Analyzed and predicted rent price trends using machine learning, providing valuable insights for local stakeholders.
*   **Lead Scoring Model for P&C Insurance**: Developed a model to optimize marketing strategies for a leading roadside insurance provider (Not public due to NDA).
*   **University of South Carolina Big Data Health Science National Case Competition**: Successfully classified neural vigilance state using CNN + LSTM and acquired 1st runner-up placement (Not public due to NDA).
*   **Humana-Mays National Case Competition** Implemented sentiment analysis, survival analysis, segmentation, and predictive modeling in proposing personalized care strategies tackling cancer therapy discontinuation, attaining Top 5 nationally (Not public due to NDA).

Achievements üèÜ
---------------

*   2nd Prize at USC's 5th National Big Data Health Science Student Case Competition.
*   Top 5 in the 2023 Humana-Mays Healthcare Analytics Case Competition.
*   First Runner Up and Best Presenter in OSU Business Analytics Case Competition.

Learning Goals üå±
-----------------

As my current learning goals, I am committed to mastering Large Language Models (LLMs) and leveraging the capabilities of OpenAI to unlock new opportunities in the business world. Also, I am looking to improve my skills in Big Data like PySpark and HDFS.
